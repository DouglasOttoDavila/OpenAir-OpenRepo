# OpenAir Automation - Open Repository

This WDIO automation project is intended to suppress the need to fill out your timesheets every week manually.
I was tired of manually filling out my timesheets weekly by repeatedly pressing `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` on multiple different OpenAir tasks, so I used WebdriverIO to make the code work for me. 

## Important
Remember to locally set up your OpenAir credentials inside the .env file located on the root of the project. The .env file was already added to the .gitignore file.
